[_Enter_ PARKER.]

<h6 class="PARKER">PARKER.</h6>  <p class="speech">Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes—who has called?</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">Lord Darlington,</h6> <p class="speech">my lady.</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Hesitates for a moment_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Show him up—and I’m at
home to any one who calls.</p>
<h6 class="PARKER">PARKER.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes, my lady.</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Exit C._]</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad
he’s come.</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]</p>
<h6 class="PARKER">PARKER.</h6>  <p class="speech">Lord Darlington,</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON _C._]</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Exit_ PARKER.]</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lady Windermere?</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">They are quite perfect.  <p class="stagedirection">[_Sees a fan lying on the
table_.]</p>  <p class="speech">And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">No?  Is it really?</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.</p>  <p class="stagedirection">[_Still arranging flowers_.]</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="stagedirection">[_Sitting down_.]</p> <p class="speech">I wish I had known it was your
birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
you.</p>
<p class="stagedirection">[_A short pause_.]</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> <p class="speech">Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">I, Lady Windermere?</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Put it there, Parker.  That will do.</p>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Wipes her hands
with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p>
<p class="speech">Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p>
<p  class="stagedirection">[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="stagedirection">[_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]</p>  I am quite
miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  <p class="stagedirection">[_Sits down at
table L._]</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
whole evening.</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Smiling_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
things we _can_ pay.</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Shaking her head_.]</p>  <p class="speech">No, I am talking very seriously.
You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Ah, but I did mean them.</p>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Takes tea which she offers
him_.]</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Gravely_.]</p>  <p class="speech">I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
think you pretend to be worse.</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> <p class="speech">We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> <p class="speech">Why do you make that your special one?</p> <p  class="stagedirection">[_Still seated
at table L._]</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_Still seated L.C._]</p>  <p class="speech">Oh, nowadays so many conceited
people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
astounding stupidity of optimism.</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,
Lord Darlington?</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes
seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down
to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady
Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.</p>
<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Why—why me?</p>
<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p  class="stagedirection">[_After a slight hesitation_.]</p> <p class="speech">Because I think we
might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend
some day.</p>
