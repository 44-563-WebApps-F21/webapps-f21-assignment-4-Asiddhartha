<h6 class="LORDDARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Oh!—we all want friends at times.</p>

<h6 class="LADYWINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">I think we’re very good friends already, Lord
Darlington.  We can always remain so as long as you don’t—LORD DARLINGTON.  Don’t what?
LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to
me.  You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?  Well, I have something of the
Puritan in me.  I was brought up like that.  I am glad of it.  My mother
died when I was a mere child.  I lived always with Lady Julia, my
father’s elder sister, you know.  She was stern to me, but she taught me
what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what
is right and what is wrong.  _She_ allowed of no compromise.  _I_ allow
of none.</p>
